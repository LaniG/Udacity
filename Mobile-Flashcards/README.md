## Project Overview
This project is my final project in the React Nanodegree course - Mobile Flashcards (also called UdaciCards).
For the UdaciCards project, I've built a mobile applicaiton that works on Android & iOS and it allows users to study using collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## Starting the app
After cloning or downlading the project .zip file, you can use:
* npm install - in the project folder to install dependencies
